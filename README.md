# Get Started with AstroWP

After you purchase AstroWP you will get two things to get your Astro with Headless WordPress site up and running:

1. GitHub repository invites (all three themes - frontend).
2. WordPress import files (all three themes - backend).

## Fork the Repository

> If you haven't already, log in to your GitHub account or create a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

After you have purchased **AstroWP**, you will receive an invite to AstroWP's GitHub repository.

**Click on the "View invitation" link in the email, and accept the invitation.**

*Are you getting a 404 error when trying to accept the invitation? Then make sure youâ€™re actually signed in to your GitHub account. Will the forked repository be private or public? When you fork the AstroWP private repository, GitHub will create a copy of that repository under your account, and it will inherit the private status of the original repository.*

### How to Fork the Repository

1. In the top-right corner of the repository page, click on **FORK**.

2. This will give you a couple of settings to configure.

3. Under **Owner**, select the dropdown menu and select yourself as the owner of the forked repository.

4. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. To distinguish your fork, **you can use a different name** in the "Repository name" field. (You can also change this later in the Settings).

5. Optionally, in the "Description" field, **type a description** of your fork. (You can also change this later in the Settings).

6. Select Copy the **main** branch only, as you only need to copy the default, main, branch.

7. Click **Create fork**, and you are done. AstroWP's repository is now yours!
