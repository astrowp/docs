### SEO

The SEO tab analyzes your post’s content in real-time. It uses the green light system, which rates your post content as good, okay, or needs improvement. Once a keyword is inserted, Yoast analyzes the content and suggests improvements.

#### Focus Keyphrase

A key phrase (or keyword) is the main word or phrase you want your content to rank for in search results.

You can also click the **Get related keyphrases** button in the meta box to add more related keywords you wish to rank for.

#### Google Preview

Google Preview gives you a glimpse of how your post will appear in search results in both desktop and mobile formats.

#### SEO Title & Slug (URL)

The SEO Page Title and the URL slug can be optimized in this section for the best results. Make sure both are not too long, and include your keyphrase for the best results.

The meta description is our "free" ad in the search results. It gives your potential visitors a reason to click. Therefore, use this tag and include your keyword(s) and describe the content accurately.

Here, you can view the Flesch reading ease score of the post. This gives you insight as to how difficult it is to read your post. Plus, it contains the word count and estimated reading time.

### Readability

Yoast uses a proprietary algorithm to make readability results reliably accurate. In most cases, you should try to get a readability score of 8 since the majority of people are comfortable reading at that level, according to the Flesch reading ease scale.

Like with SEO analysis, the scores are based on factors that are highlighted as problems (red), improvements (orange), and good results (green). In the example below, a section length issue is detected. Plus, you can quickly locate problem areas by clicking the “eye” icon next to each item in the list.
