{
  "API_URL": "https://astrowp-demo.instawp.xyz",
  "site": {
    "url": "https://astrowp-saas-theme.vercel.app"
  },
  "post_types": ["Glossary"]
}
~~~

The ```API_URL variable``` is used to connect your WordPress site; it should be the full URL of where it is hosted e.g. https://astrowp-demo.instawp.xyz

The ```site:url variable``` is used to connect your published/deployed site to canonical links, XML sitemap etc., it should be the full URL e.g. https://astrowp.com

**The ```post_types variable``` registers ACF custom post types used on the WordPress site.**

To register multiple custom post types, you simply use this syntax:

```
"post_types": ["Glossary", "Coupons"]
```

```
"post_types": ["Glossary", "Coupons", "Projects"]
```
