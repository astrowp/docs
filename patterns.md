# Gutenberg Blocks & Patterns

Gutenberg patterns, or "blocks," are pre-built elements that can be added to a page or a post and then customized further.

> The Astro themes support Gutenberg blocks and patterns, but additional styling will be needed for some patterns.

Here is a list of supported blocks:

- Paragraph block
- Image block
- Link block
- Button block
- Column block
- Table block
- Code block
- Embed block

For an example, see https://portfolio-theme-demo.astrowp.com/posts/wordpress-demo-content/

I have created several ready-made patterns for you to use in posts and pages, go to **Appearance -> Patterns**

that you can easily add and customize further to posts and pages you create.
