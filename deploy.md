# Deployment

In general, you can deploy the application to any hosting provider that supports Node.js, but I  recommend using <a href="https://vercel.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vercel</a> for the best experience.

## Deploying to Vercel 

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy Next.js apps. It's the company behind Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js.

### Setup vercel account

To host your project on Vercel you first have to <a href="https://vercel.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">create an account</a>.

Connect your git repository

After signing up, you will be prompted to import a GitHub repository. Select the GitHub provider for your project and connect your GitHub account with Vercel.

Now you will see a list of all your projects. Select the project you want to deploy and click on the <strong>Import</strong> button.</p>
