## 4. Deploy the site

Now click on the Deploy site button and wait for the deployment to finish. After that, you should be able to visit your freshly deployed SaaS.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Select function region for better performance
After your site has been deployed, go to Site configuration -> Build & deploy -> Functions region and select the region closest region to where your database is hosted. This will reduce the loading time of your api functions and improve the overall performance of your SaaS.

Make sure to redeploy your site after changing the region by clicking the Trigger deploy button on the Deploys page of your project.
